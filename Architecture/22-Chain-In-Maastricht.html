                <p>During urban research in Maastricht, local residents drew their cognitive maps of the city. Interestingly, they perceived the city's connectivity through several bridges spanning the Maas River, while familiar city limits were determined by prominent landmarks. Therefore, in designing the transitional areas for the revitalization of the northern old industrial district in Maastricht's city center, I aim to establish connectivity through linear links and terminal landmarks. </p>

                <p>This approach aims to broaden public perception of the city beyond its historical and industrial aspects, transforming it into a porous nexus linking culture, creativity, and manufacturing—a city of multifaceted connections.</p>

                <h3>Color Experiment!</h3>
                <p>How can we transform a dull, homogenized old industrial area into an engaging public space? Let's inject some color! Yellow, resembling chains, links various intricate mechanical spaces, while adding structures at a human scale amidst the vast buildings. The city becomes a playable set of blocks, where surprises await around every corner.</p>

                <h3>The past, present, and future.</h3>
                <p>Around 1700, the urban fabric of Maastricht was characterized by the organic growth of the medieval city center juxtaposed with the peripheral defensive fortifications. The site lies at the northern edge of the ancient city, adjacent to the defensive walls. The Industrial Revolution propelled Maastricht into becoming the foremost industrial port city in the Netherlands, with industries like ceramics and papermaking flourishing in the outskirts, forming vast landscapes of factories. Simultaneously, the excavation of artificial canals integrated the inland areas with the Maas River. Today, amidst industrial transition, many factories lie abandoned. The former Sphinx ceramics factory has been repurposed into a creative cultural center, while the Sappi paper mill remains a solitary industrial relic in the city.</p>
                <p>The palpable disconnect between the historical city, modern renovations, and the decline of old factories pervades the site. So, how can we reconcile the contradictions between history, creativity, and enclosed industrial spaces? How can design bridge these three distinct realms? Is it possible for Maastricht to reclaim its status as a pinnacle of manufacturing in this new era?</p>
