                <p>The site spans the ancient canal and is on the bank of the South Lake. It is a unique location at the end of Jiaxing's historical and cultural axis, where nature, humanities, and historical and cultural meanings converge.</p> 
                <P>We regard the bridge as the link between the city and nature, the past and the present, the pedestrian and the landscape, and fully explore and utilize the material and non-material resources of the site and surrounding areas. Memory is the bone, the memory of the canal, the memory of Jiaxing, and the memory of Nanhu meet here, and evolve into a stretched curve, connecting the two sides of the canal; time is the guide, and the memory spanning the past and the present will be tightly blended here, connecting the past and the future.</P>

                <h3>Form Generation</h3>
                <p>The name "Hewang"(禾望) comes from the city of Jiaxing, which is also named Hecheng. The word "He"(禾)originated in the Shang Dynasty and is a hieroglyph from millet.</p>
                <p>The shape of the bridge is taken from the shape of the word "He", which is like a vigorous ear of rice, bringing vitality to the green space on both sides of the river. The center of the bridge is solid and straight, providing a solid connection for the green spaces on both sides of the strait. The end of the bridge is like a slender and soft pine leaf, stretching and slowly connecting to the two banks. "Wang"(望) means looking at the past and present. The Bridge connects the historical relics such as Jiaxing Zicheng and Haogu Pagoda, and awakens the cultural memory of the city; it also reinterprets simplicity and elegance with a vigorous and light modern style, and provides citizens with a dynamic and diverse slow-moving public space.</p>

                <p>
                    The bridge's design gracefully bends within the limited confines of the designated area, connecting the two banks. At the bottom of the image, the bridge deck gently slopes upward, gradually rising until its highest point is positioned above the railway tracks, directly facing the ancient tower, creating an observation platform on the bridge. The bridge extends like a sweeping tail, utilizing steps to create public space and guide visitors towards the scenic area of South Lake.</p>

                <h3>Bridge as Public Space</h3>
                <p>The design retains the rest platform on the original two shores. The bridge surface slowly lifts between the two platforms. The people who look at the scenery on the bridge also become the scenery in the eyes of the predecessors under the bridge.</p>
                <p>The bridge body is divided into two branches on the lake. The left side can walk down slowly and walk along the river; the right side can stop and rest and enjoy the scenery of the canal.</p>
                <p>The anti-throw fence on the railway is designed as a smooth and curved wall, which eliminates the boring and depression at the height, and allows children to experience the wonderful music of the hand slippery grille.</p>
                <p>As the part of the axis of the ancient city culture, the end of the bridge points to the ancient tower, implying the endlessness of Jiaxing's culture history. The expanding platform also provides tourists with an excellent viewing angle and rest space.</p>

                <h3>Structural Design</h3>
                <p>The substructure like piers, caps, etc. and superstructure like steel box girder of the bridge are prefabricated in the factories, transported to the construction site for assembly. This process can reduce the environmental impacts and carbon emissions. The construction process achieves design standardization, product modularization, and assembly mechanization.</p>
