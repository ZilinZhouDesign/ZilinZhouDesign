                <p>"Book of Changes" records that the sky is Xuan and the earth is yellow. Xuan Pavilion pointed to the quiet and distant sky with the plank road extending upwards from the earth. Xuan is also an ancient word for hanging, which means that the extremely light structure supports the plank stairs and respects the original appearance of the site with a small intervention.</p>

                <p>Looking at the Xuan Pavilion, the winding trails are reflected on the water, connecting the sky and the earth into one. You can enter the scenic spot at the entrance pavilion when you walk on the floating road. The slender wooden pillars and diagonal braces form the overall structure, and when you climb up, it is like traveling through the forests with trunks. The terraces on both sides of the north and south, which are connected by folding stairs, overlook the lakeside and the Yangtze River in the distance. The observation station at the highest point, through the rising roof, looks into the higher heaven and earth, watching the clouds and rains dissipate, and the birds fIy.</p>

                <p>The bird observatory room is at the very top of the building, pointing towards the Yangtze River, where people can observe migratory birds. The roof is raised forward, bringing the view forward, and the wooden grilles on both sides are also dense to sparse, creating a feeling of gradual thinning of the view.</p>

                <h3>Lightweight Structure</h3>
                <p>The structure of the Xuanting Pavilion consists of a combination of concrete foundation and a glued laminated timber frame fixed with steel nodes. It is constructed using a modular unit system of 3x3 meters, facilitating prefabrication to minimize on-site construction pollution. The timber structure transitions from a simple beam-column system to a double-column structure, with the columns between units connected by framework beams. This design enhances the building's sense of lightness visually and facilitates the installation of stairs and diagonal bracing components.</p>
                <p>At the base, the connection of concrete and wooden columns through steel nodes elevates the wooden columns from the ground, reducing the impact of wetland moisture on the strength of the timber structure. The diagonal beams at the staircase locations are fixed by vertical columns, further reinforcing the overall structure. The junctions of beams and columns on the terraces are strengthened through steel nodes.</p>
