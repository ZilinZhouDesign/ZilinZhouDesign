                <p>The Grand Theater is located at the head of Pinghu Peninsula, where the Yangtze River and its tributary, Huangbai River, converge within the jurisdiction of Yichang City, Hubei Province, China. It faces the Three Gorges Cruise Terminal across the river and spans a total floor area of approximately 70,000 square meters.</p>

                <p>This is an architecture deeply connected to water, 
                    an architecture that breathes, 
                    an edifice that preserves the site's natural landscape through its construction,
                    a theater designed for everyone.</p>
                    
                <p>The building serves multiple functions, including a 1600-seat grand theater, a 1200-seat music hall, a 400-seat black box theater, along with two outdoor theaters, a rooftop theater, and a waterside theater. In addition to performance spaces, the architecture accommodates diverse functions such as education, events, rehearsals, exhibitions, cafes, restaurants, and scenic viewpoints. This versatility allows the Grand Theater to function as an all-weather, vibrant public cultural venue.</p>

                <h3>Ecological Strategy</h3>
                <p>The Grand Theater is situated on the Peninsula of Pinghu, where the Yangtze River and its tributary, the Huangbai River, converge within the boundaries of Yichang City in Hubei Province. It faces the Yangtze River and overlooks the Sanxia Cruise Terminal on the opposite bank. Against the backdrop of the broader context of the Yangtze River's conservation and the global ecological crisis, the construction of the Grand Theater requires a particularly sensitive response to the natural conditions surrounding the site. It aims to rehabilitate the previously human-altered site, reestablishing a harmonious and sustainable balance between nature and construction.</p>

                <p>The design inspiration for the Grand Theater draws from the rivers of Yichang. Though appearing gentle, water harbors boundless power. Water is the soul of Yichang, a unique city nestled amid mountains and rivers. The theater, like dynamic water, reveals different shapes from various perspectives, offering a diverse canvas for interpretation.</p>

                <p>A winding, ascending public promenade connects the ground-level waterside theater, the rooftop sky theater, and an observation platform at the highest point, offering panoramic views of the Xiling Gorge. The promenade and outdoor public spaces will be open to all, bringing a futuristic architectural marvel and the unique bay area scenery to everyone.</p>

                <p>While perceiving and capturing the ambiance of the site, the generation of the fluid architectural form also arises from the interaction of various energies, including internal functional organization, external environmental conditions, and the civic activity spaces that permeate inside and outside, top to bottom, resulting in a balanced and inclusive state. The front-of-house public spaces take on a free and open form, offering citizens a diverse and flexible public space. The backstage is designed in an orthogonal grid format, creating semi-outdoor service spaces with a sense of retreat.</p>

                <h3>Gridshell Structure</h3>
                <p>The structural prototype is derived from the Gridshell envisioned by Vladimir Shukhov in the 1890s. Essentially, it is a quadrilateral mesh that can adapt to various forms. One of its significant advantages is that all members within the quadrilateral mesh or grid have equal lengths. The grid angles can vary to accommodate different shapes. Ideally, the Gridshell transforms a pure tensile net into a pure compression shell.</p>
                <p>The primary support structure on the west side of the platform consists of six cast-in-place concrete columns. Among these, three columns incorporate vertical circulation elements such as stairs and elevators, while the remaining three columns are of a hollow square cross-section and are solely used for structural support.</p>
                <p>The stitched Gridshell seamlessly integrates structural visibility by connecting the visible 3-meter zone with the concealed 6-meter area.</p>

                <h3>Pipe Skin</h3>
                <p>The portion of the building facing the peninsula features a double-layered skin. The inner layer exhibits simple yet intricate geometric forms to accommodate the complex functional requirements. The outer layer consists of continuous aluminum tube cladding that integrates with the overall structure. The distance between these two layers varies according to interior needs, creating diverse interstitial spaces for regulating the building's microclimate. </p>
                <p>The aluminum tube cladding forms a textured pattern reminiscent of water ripples, transforming the solid surface into graceful lines. Additionally, the on-site cold bending process helps reduce construction costs.</p>

The floating theater also provides artists and production staff with naturally ventilated and well-lit spaces, significantly improving their working conditions and fostering opportunities for interaction between performers and the public. Extensive semi-outdoor gardens and numerous terraced gardens offer comfortable green spaces for relaxation and scenic views. </p>
