                <p>This project represents a fusion of architectural principles with bio-structural concepts, serving as a manifesto for an innovative approach to structure and space.</p>
                <p>The pursuit of novel structures that align harmoniously with the inherent properties of materials invariably leads to the creation of captivating spatial experiences. In today's academic landscape, a collective of scholars has embarked on interdisciplinary research bridging the realms of biology and architecture. Their aim is to optimize structural design and introduce fresh spatial paradigms by drawing inspiration from the natural world.</p>

                <h3>Forest-like Ecosystem</h3>
                <p>The objective was to explore the potential for future skyscrapers while addressing two significant challenges: the excessive material waste prevalent in construction and the repetitive spatial configurations dominated by core tubes. By employing form-finding techniques inspired by tree branches and conducting topological optimization assessments, a conceptual framework for high-rise structures emerged.</p>
                <p>This endeavor envisions the possibility of a future modern city characterized by high-rises seamlessly integrated into a forest-like ecosystem. These structures are envisioned to be connected freely, offering adaptable spaces that can cater to the needs of generations to come.</p>

                <p>Through form-finding of tree branches and the evaluations on topology optimization, a spatial prototype for high-rise buildings has been discovered. </p>
                <p>The traditional concrete core tubes are re-assembled to four corners to make the structure stable. Optimized branches could connect the outer skins and inner transits to strengthen the whole structures as a whole.</p>

                <p>The new transportation system is integrated into this structure: vertical elevators are placed in the four reinforced concrete corners, escalators in the inner branches and escape stairs in the outer branches. Such transportation design renders the inner spaces more liberated and fIexible.  </p>
