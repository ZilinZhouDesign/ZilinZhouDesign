                <p>Designed with ecology at the core, the green pedestrian bridge aims to connect and activate spaces on both sides of the river through a "threading needle" design approach. Its purpose is to use ecology as a medium to create a highly vibrant central public service and leisure zone, showcasing the vitality of the Pukou District's southern urban area.
                </p>
                <p>We believe that the theme of "Ecological Bridge" not only enhances the city's landscape axis but also serves as a symbolic emblem of ecological creativity for the modernized new Pukou. The design of the Green Weave Bridge will ecologically link the vegetation on both sides of the river, creating continuous habitats for different species. Moreover, the two slender footbridges meandering across the Green Weave Bridge will connect the surrounding core areas, establishing a multifunctional composite bridge serving citizens' needs, encompassing ecology, leisure, commerce, and office spaces.</p>

                <h3>Ecological Link</h3>
                <p>The bridge serves as an ecological link, uniting the fragmented green spaces on both banks into a cohesive whole. The main bridge structure transitions from straight to curved, directing the entrance and exit towards the plaza, guiding pedestrian flow. We aim to provide pedestrians with ample space for leisurely strolls on the bridge and opportunities for diverse experiences as they move through the scenery.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the fast transit system of the secondary bridge intertwines with the slow transit system of the main bridge, offering multiple access points to enter the park and riverbank. Simultaneously, it facilitates connectivity between the commercial complex on both banks, enhancing the accessibility of urban public spaces from multiple dimensions.</p>

                <p>Reflecting Nanjing's profound connection to its natural surroundings, including mountains, rivers, and forests, as well as its vibrant spirit of innovation, we infuse the main bridge with a sense of robustness and vitality, representing the essence of ecology. In contrast, the secondary bridge embodies the pace of urban life, characterized by lightness and agility. This striking juxtaposition enhances the bridge's aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, visitors and passersby alike can discover their own rhythm here, creating a harmonious fusion of solidity and lightness within the urban environment.</p>

                <h3>Ecological Design</h3>
                <p>The Green Weave Bridge in Pukou District will be a key part of the city's green development. It will blend seamlessly with the surrounding park, connecting native plants and wildlife from both sides of the river, promoting biodiversity. The bridge deck will feature local trees, shrubs, and grasses, creating a beautiful display of Nanjing's ecology throughout the year.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the bridge will offer a space for people to relax and interact with nature, providing a peaceful escape from urban life. Picture pedestrians walking along the bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and the sounds of birds chirping. Visitors can take a moment to sit on benches, enjoy the flowers, and admire the river views.</p>

                <h3>Varied Walking Paths</h3>
                <p>The system comprises a main greenery-infused bridge and a fast transit elevated walkway. The former, with an S-shaped design, serves as a leisurely pedestrian pathway, while the latter, with subtle height variations, facilitates faster pedestrian movement. The fast and slow transit systems are interconnected by two junction bridges, allowing seamless transition between leisurely strolls and brisk walks amidst nature and urban hustle.</p>
                <p>To accommodate the varied transit systems, different materials and pavements are employed. The main bridge features stable and robust concrete brick paving, while the elevated walkway utilizes white plastic granules for added shock absorption and anti-slip properties. Additionally, wooden elements are incorporated in the resting areas of the main bridge to enhance the comfort and inviting nature of public gathering spaces.</p>

                <p>The Green Weave Bridge's unique understanding of ecology and composite systems has contributed to its elegant form. To further accentuate its aesthetic appeal, we have carefully designed the lighting underneath the bridge, enhancing the city's vibrant nighttime scenery.</p>
                <p>The lighting design can be divided into two parts. The first part focuses on enhancing the bridge's form with spotlights placed on both banks and linear LED strips underneath the bridge. Additionally, to improve the pedestrian experience on the bridge, small decorative lights are placed along the pathways, providing illumination amidst the greenery and wooden decking. Linear LED strips are installed underneath bench seats to create a cozy atmosphere and enhance the urban landscape.</p>
