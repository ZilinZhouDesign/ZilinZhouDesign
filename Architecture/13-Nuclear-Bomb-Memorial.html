                <p>The Pandora's box of nuclear weapons has been opened, and now we must face the future under the shadow of deterrence.</p>
                <p>After the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Japan, subsequent nuclear tests were conducted on the remote Marshall Islands to avoid environmental damage to its own soil. In February 1946, American engineers arrived at Bikini Atoll and forcibly relocated its inhabitants from their ancestral lands. As the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union escalated, the United States decided to develop even more powerful hydrogen bombs. The immense power of nuclear explosions caused the disappearance of the islands where the hydrogen bombs were detonated, leaving behind deep craters.</p>

                <h3>Remembering the Victims</h3>
                <p>Many residents, fishermen, and even some American soldiers were exposed to nuclear radiation. Dozens of people died from cancer, leukemia, and other radiation-related illnesses within a short period. This led to the largest nuclear contamination event in the Pacific Ocean. From 1946 to 1958, the United States conducted 67 nuclear tests in the area, turning this once-beautiful natural paradise into a contaminated wasteland, resembling blood seeping into the ocean.</p>
                <p>Between 1977 and 1980, the United States dispatched soldiers to the Enewetak Atoll to dump contaminated soil and other radioactive waste into a crater formed by nuclear explosions. They then sealed it with concrete to form a "dome." However, in recent years, seismic activity and rising sea levels have caused cracks and gaps to appear in the dome, posing a risk of nuclear waste being directly discharged into the ocean. This has raised concerns worldwide.</p>
                <p>We hope to erect a memorial to nuclear testing on this land, which has endured so much suffering, to comfort those who have lost their lives to radiation and those who have been displaced by the destruction of their homes.</p>

                <h3>Memorial and Dome</h3>
                <p>The crater left by the nuclear bomb and the dome constructed to bury radioactive waste appeared simultaneously, resembling the wounds of the earth and the attempted healing scabs. The design of the memorial is set within a circular water pit, overlooking the dome still leaking nuclear waste</p>
                <p>At the same time, the memorial stands as a beacon in the sky, guiding people's gaze toward the natural world ravaged by human desires. Suspended between the dome and the memorial are thousands of floating purifiers, placed along magnetic field lines, filtering toxic substances from the seawater to mitigate the leakage crisis.</p>

                <p>The shimmering lights of the sea purifiers converge towards the center, growing brighter with each passing moment, beckoning people from around the world affected by nuclear bombs to gather here, transforming this place into a sanctuary of emotional purification. Visitors can ascend along the spiraling walkway inside the tower, where increasing rays of light filter in, allowing them to experience a sense of inner peace amidst the turmoil of the past. Amidst the dome, the memorial, and the luminous beacon of hope, humanity finds solace and healing.</p>
