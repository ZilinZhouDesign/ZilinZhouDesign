                <p>The Shede Museum is located in the East Garden of the Shede Cultural Tourism Area, covering an area of 6,457 square meters with a total construction area of 9,724 square meters. Designed with inspiration drawn from Shede liquor culture, the concept is rooted in the principles of nature, ecology, and the cyclical nature of time, emphasizing cultural spirit. The design introduces the concept of "One Pond, Three Mountains."</p>

                <p>The concept of "One Pond, Three Mountains" originates from Chinese garden and Taoist philosophy, employing Eastern garden techniques to create an ethereal environment and spaces infused with Chinese cultural spirit. Through simple forms, the design aims to generate rich phenomena and experiences. The pond is enclosed by a circular gallery, and the three mountains refer to glass, rammed earth, and bronze boxes.</p>
                    
                <p>The circular gallery surrounds the water courtyard, with the bronze box floating on the water, the rammed earth box sitting in the water, and the glass box partly submerged and partly exposed. The three volumes have varying heights and positions. Among them, the bronze box's viewing platform is higher than the highest point of the art hotel, offering a panoramic view of the flowing river and the entire park.</p>
                    
                <p>The materials for the three boxes are chosen from the most representative natural and perceptible materials related to liquor. These materials change over time, becoming richer and more vibrant, reflecting the dynamic and lively nature of the surroundings.</p>

                <h3>Time and Cycle</h3>
                <p>To the Zhou, alcohol had a special cosmological significance. In the duality of heaven and earth, fermentation revealed a universe in constant fIux.</p>
                <p> The Shede Experience Center is located on the west side of the eastern entrance of the Shede Cultural and Tourism Zone, with its design inspired by the Shedo wine culture. It is based on the principles of nature-ecology, time-cycle, and culture-spirit. The design concept incorporates the idea of "One Pond, Three Hills," which originates from Chinese garden and Taoist philosophy. It employs Eastern landscaping techniques to create a mystical and spiritually rich space with a distinct Chinese cultural essence, using simple forms to generate a diverse array of on-site experiences.</p>

                <h3>Glass box</h3>
                <p>A glass box is partially submerged in water, with half of it above the water's surface. The glass box has a square plan, with the first floor serving as the entrance hall and the starting point for visitors. The second floor functions as office and VIP reception space, while the underground levels house areas for children's activities and a report hall. The exterior facade is constructed from glass bricks, creating a sense of mysterious disappearance. Water flows down from the roof onto the glass bricks, streaming into a sunken courtyard that encircles the building, forming a dynamic water curtain that complements the still water inside the pool.</p>

                <h3>Rammed Earth Box</h3>
                <p>The rammed earth box is situated on water and serves as the central exhibition space, featuring two primary exhibition areas designed to meet the requirements of digital displays within open dark spaces. The rammed earth used in this structure originates from the local soil of Shehong, including the yellow clay used for the wine cellars. The inclusion of embedded stones, tiles, and fragments of wine barrels in the rammed earth facade adds a sense of vitality and organic appeal. The soil allows for natural ventilation, encapsulating the power of life within.</p>

                <h3>Bronze Box</h3>
                <p>The bronze box hovers above the water surface, with the ground fIoor serving as a shop featuring a glass facade that provides a view of the water. Visitors can access the second fIoor exhibition hall via an elevated corridor from the rammed earth box. The third fIoor houses workshops where visitors can participate in the wine-making process or engage in scientific experiments. The fourth fIoor features a panoramic restaurant where guests can savor wine while enjoying breathtaking views through massive glass windows. </p>
                <p>The exterior facade of the building is adorned with semi-cylindrical bronze panels, reminiscent of bronze wine barrels. These cylindrical elements create sound when subjected to airflow, resembling musical instruments. The bronze undergoes color changes over time, imbuing the building with a sense of sedimentation akin to the aging of wine.</p>
